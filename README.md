# Thesis Repository

This repository has been created by Norman Chizzali and Djordje Dimitrov for the 2DV50E course at Linnaeus University. It includes a collection of submodules from various repositories used to successfully develop our project.

## Submodules

- **coralmicro**: A fork of the official Google Coral repository, necessary for dependencies required by the `google-coral-micro-object-detection` repository.
- **frame-processor**: This repository is designed for extracting and preprocessing frames from annotated videos. 
- **google-coral-micro-object-detection**: A modified fork of an existing repository for collecting images and running inference on the Coral board micro. This version includes an additional option to record videos on the board.
- **object_detection_edge_impulse_cpp**: A generic C++ library designed to run inference on any device equipped with a C++ compiler.
